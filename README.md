# Sound synthesis

Waveform based sound synthesis engine. It's a proof of concept helping implementing target synthesizer on STM32 ARM processor.

What's included:

1. BPM Clock with trigger and gate
2. Sequencer
3. ADSR envelope
4. State Variable Filter
5. Phase modulation
6. Waveform generators + collection imported from [Plaits](https://mutable-instruments.net/modules/plaits/)
7. Waveform oscillator

To play a sound load and run `sound.core` (use `toggle-playing` to start/stop sound generation). `sound.patch` defines whole configuration of the synthesizer you can change it live.

## Implementation notes

To allow easy translation to C++ every engine contains custom records (created by `defrecord`) separately for configuration and state.
